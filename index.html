<h2>
<a name="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>The program <code>easyQC</code> is an external tool for statistical process and quality
control in mass spectrometry workflows that integrates nicely in the <a href="https://skyline.gs.washington.edu/labkey/project/home/software/Skyline/begin.view">Skyline
Targeted Proteomics
Environment</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a name="feature-list-at-a-glance" class="anchor" href="#feature-list-at-a-glance"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Feature list at a glance</h2>

<ul>
<li>Automatically sorts your data by date and time, and orders your observations
with the most recent on the right.  ("What? Does this mean I don't need to
sort my data manually, as it is the case for some other software tools out
there?", "Yes.")</li>
<li>Dynamically adapts to custom report templates. (See details below.)</li>
<li>Flow charts for single peptides can optionally be grouped together by their
common protein accession.   (See details below.)</li>
<li>Plots are generated in a nice page layout, ready for printing.</li>
<li>Observations are colour-coded by a beneficial four-colour-code.  This makes
it particularly easy to detect deviations from the norm.</li>
<li>Has a built in outlier detection, which provides you with useful robust
features.  (See details below.)</li>
<li>Plot as <em>many</em> flow charts for as <em>many</em> peptides as you like.</li>

<a name="installation-using-the-skyline-gui" class="anchor" href="#installation-using-the-skyline-gui"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation using the skyline GUI</h2>

<p>Simply follow the GUI-clicking adventure by successively clicking on <code>Tools -&gt;
External Tools -&gt; External Tool Store</code>.  In the appearing list select (click
on) <code>easyQC</code>.  You will be promoted for the path to <code>Rscript</code>, which needs to
be installed on you system.</p>

<p>We have realised that since the introduction of "Live Reports" in new Versions
of Skyline, the import of new templates might fail.  If this is the case for
you, make sure two switch off "Live Reports", restart Skyline, and try the
installation again.</p>

<p>The underlying code-base of <code>easyQC</code> relies on the R-packages
<a href="http://ggplot2.org/">ggplot2</a>, <a href="http://plyr.had.co.nz/">plyr</a> and
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/chron/index.html">chron</a>.  Fortunately,
all these packages are hosted on <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>, and should
automatically be installed into your R-environment, when installing <code>easyQC</code> in
Skyline.  If, for some reasons, this should not be the case for you, make sure
these three packages are installed in your R-environment.</p>

<h2>
<a name="description" class="anchor" href="#description"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Description</h2>

<p>The software comes with an exemplary report template called <code>easyQC</code>.  We
recommend to just go with this template, but feel free to create your own.  The
absolute necessary fields your template should contain are:
<code>PeptideModifiedSequence</code> and <code>PrecursorMz</code>.  These two fields are used as
identifiers for your peptides, and, thus, all other fields should uniquely be
identifiable by these two.  Optionally, the field <code>ProteinName</code> can be added to
your template.</p>

<p>By default, the flow charts of ten peptides are grouped together into one plot
each.  If your report template also contains the associated protein accession
of each peptide, namely the field <code>ProteinName</code>, then all peptides which belong
to the same protein accession are grouped into one plot.</p>

<p>Before the calculation of the mean and standard deviations of each flow chart,
the software will do some outlier detection of your data, namely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grubbs%27_test_for_outliers">Grubbs' test
for outliers</a> will be
applied.  Observations which are classified as outliers by this test are
discarded in the estimation of the mean and standard deviations.   This gives
the estimated means and standard deviations some desirable
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_statistics">robust</a> features.</p>

<p>On Linux, you simply need to add the directory in which you have cloned
<code>easyQC</code>'s repository to your path.  Also make sure that <code>easyQC.r</code> is
executable.</p>

<pre><code>% git clone https://github.com/00tau/skyline-addon-easyqc.git
% cd skyline-addonn-easyqc
% chmod +x easyQC.r
% PATH=$(pwd):$PATH
</code></pre>

<p>The synopsis is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>easyQC.r [OPTIONS] REPORTFILE
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>OPTIONS</code> is either <code>verbose</code> or noting.  For example, to produce some
quality control plots from a file <code>some-report-file.csv</code> that has been
generated by Skyline via some report template (e.g. the template <code>easyQC.skyr</code>
should come in mind here), run either one of the following two code lines from
the command line.</p>

<pre><code>% easyQC.r some-report-file.csv
% easyQC.r verbose some-report-file.csv
</code></pre>

<p>This will produce a file <code>some-report-file.pdf</code> with all the plots you need.</p>

<p>If for some reasons, you are interested in installing the latest GitHub-version
(or any other version of this software that is available on GitHub), the
repository contains a convenient Makefile that will create the necessary files
for the installation process for you.  Simply type:</p>

<pre><code>% make
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a <code>easyQC.zip</code> file which contains the needed install scripts
for Skyline.  Now, just follow your Skyline-GUI.</p>
