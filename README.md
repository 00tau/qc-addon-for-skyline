qc-addon-for-skyline
====================

Will be an add-on script for performing easy quality control tasks within
Skyline.

Currently, you need to clone this repository, and make the script `qcbymm.r`
executable.  Then you should be good to go.

```
% git clone https://github.com/00tau/qc-addonn-for-skyline.git
% cd qc-addon-for-skyline
% chmod +x qcbymm.r
```

For example to produce some quality control plots from a csv-file that has been
generated by Skyline via the ..., run the following code from the command line.

```
% ./qcbymm.r example.cvs
```

This will produce a file `example.pdf` with all the plots you need.

If you know that you have access to a Linux system but you don't know how, you
may ask your system administrator to assist you.
