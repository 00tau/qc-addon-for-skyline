qc-addon-for-skyline
====================

Introduction
------------

This is an add-on script for performing easy quality control tasks within
Skyline.

Adding the script to the tool box in Skyline
--------------------------------------------

On Linux:

```
% git clone https://github.com/00tau/qc-addonn-for-skyline.git
% cd qc-addon-for-skyline
% make
```

This will create a `qcbymm.zip` file which contains the needed install scripts
for Skyline.  Just follow your Skyline-GUI.


Running the script as a stand-alone
-----------------------------------

On Linux:

```
% git clone https://github.com/00tau/qc-addonn-for-skyline.git
% cd qc-addon-for-skyline
% chmod +x qcbymm.r
```

For example, to produce some quality control plots from an `example.csv` file
that has been generated by Skyline via the `qcbymm.skyr` report template, run
the following code from the command line.

```
% ./qcbymm.r example.cvs
```

This will produce a file `example.pdf` with all the plots you need.
